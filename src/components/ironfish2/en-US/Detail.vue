    <h3>Exclusive Limited Time Offer!</h3>

    <p>We are so happy and excited to announce that the first 500 ‘Early Bird’ units of Iron Fish First Batch Mining <strong>sold out in under two hours!</strong> We are extremely thankful to you, our community, for your overwhelming support and patience, and we cannot express our gratitude enough.</p>

    <p>We have received tons of requests for more inventory, but under normal circumstances it takes 15 days to start mining Iron Fish after payment because the mining machines require initial setup.</p>

    <p>However, thanks to our relationship with Hpool and due to the overwhelmingly positive response from the community <strong>we were able to negotiate for additional units from their own limited reserve that will mine from day 1 of mainnet!</strong></p>

    <p>Ulike the ‘Early Bird’ batch, since additional units will come from <strong>Hpool’s own limited reserve, they will NOT be refundable.</strong></p>

    <h3>Why Iron Fish &amp; its Technology are Important to Web3</h3>

    <p>Iron Fish is a Layer 1 blockchain that, like Aleo, that is <strong>aiming to become the universal privacy layer for transactions on Web3</strong> by leveraging zk-SNARKs to enable users to have fully private transactions – an element that most current blockchains lack.</p>

    <p>With its decentralized, proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithm and censorship-resistant features, Iron Fish offers <strong>easy-to-use, fully-private payments</strong> and improves upon the Sapling protocol first created by Zcash to enable even more efficient and secure private transactions.</p>

    <h4>NOTE:</h4>

    <p>While Ironfish does have technology that competes with HashRate Demo’s other offering of Aleo, we are very bullish about zero knowledge for Web3. Thus, we want to bring a diverse portfolio of products to our community. The expectation is for zero knowledge to be a major part of blockchain projects from now into the future.</p>

    <p>The core difference between Aleo and Iron Fish it that Aleo has programmability for applications, NFTs, games, and more from the start of its mainnet. However, Iron Fish will use a Layer 2, the Ethereum Virtual Machine, for future programmability.</p>

    <p>Privacy-focused blockchains before 2023 all have drawbacks in terms of privacy, accessibility, or both. <strong>Iron Fish does not compromise on privacy</strong>, while still being extremely easy to use. The application layer is written in Typescript, a popular programming language, which allows for simple end-user integrations and interactions.</p>

    <p>The key innovation of Iron Fish is the way it provides full privacy <strong>while still being compliant with government regulations</strong>. Zcash and Monero are 100% private, meaning criminals can conduct money laundering and other illicit transactions on those chains.</p>

    <p>With Iron Fish, all transactions are 100% private by default, but any user can give a third party, for example a government auditor, a view key which allows only the view key holder to see the user’s transactions.</p>

    <p>In this way, Iron Fish users can rest assured that they <strong>will be able to fully comply with any financial audits or anti-money laundering (AML) investigations</strong> while maintaining daily privacy for transactions.</p>

    <h3>Launch Schedule &amp; Roadmap</h3>

    <p>One thing all top VCs look for in a project is its <strong>ability to meet deadlines and deliver everything promised on time</strong>, and in this regard Iron Fish has been stellar. Iron Fish has a public roadmap website where everyone can check their progress. Throughout 2022 / 2023 leading up to the mainnet launch, they have <strong>completed everything on schedule</strong> including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All final blockchain adjustments, optimizations, and audits</li>
      <li>The development of a fully functional Iron Fish wallet</li>
      <li>Incentivized testnets</li>
      <li>A public block explorer website</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In fact, the final testnet was so active and successful that they <strong>finished ahead of schedule</strong> on February 25th instead of the originally scheduled March 7th and <strong>the mainnet launch is set for March 14th</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Hpool Dominates the Iron Fish Testnet</h3>

    <p>As with Chia, Hpool dominated the competition during Iron Fish’s testnet, <strong>finishing #1: with Chia, Hpool was 80% network dominant, and Iron Fish is looking similar</strong>.</p>

    <p>Hpool's total point value is <strong>nearly 3 times higher than second place</strong> (1teliduxingdezhu – 6,851,691 points) and <strong>over 4 times higher than third place</strong> (ZK.Work – 4,343,957 points).</p>

    <p>What’s more, Hpool's total points on the testnet were 252,169 points <strong>more than the point totals of second to fifth place combined</strong>, showing just how truly ahead of the competition they are in Iron Fish mining.</p>
